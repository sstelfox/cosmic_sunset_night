# Cosmic Sunset Night

This project is me playing around with storing arbitrary value time-series data
in Redis and displaying them cleanly in various graphing libraries. I'm using
MtGox's live statistics API queried intermittently to create a sort of
stock-ticker with their data.

This is really a toy repository and is neither production ready nor should be
expected to produce a valuable output.
